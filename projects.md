## üåü My Computer Vision Projects

Below are some of my own computer vision projects. Explore the code, try them out, and get inspired!

### [Open-CV-examples](https://github.com/sadhanasharma26/Open-CV-examples.git)
**Short Description:** This repository contains few snippets of codes that I practiced while learning Open CV.

### [depth-estimation-using-OpenCV](https://github.com/sadhanasharma26/depth-estimation-using-OpenCV.git)
**Short Description:** A Python project for real-time depth estimation using stereo vision, leveraging OpenCV and live video from two cameras. This system demonstrates the practical use of computer vision to compute accurate depth and disparity maps ‚Äî essential for robotics, augmented reality, and autonomous vehicle applications.

### [numberplate_ocr](https://github.com/sadhanasharma26/numberplate_ocr.git)
**Short Description:** A Python project for automatic detection and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) of vehicle license plates from images using OpenCV, EasyOCR, and computer vision techniques.
